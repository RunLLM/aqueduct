Eduardo I am a Brazilian physician who spent a few days at the 25hours Hotel in Vienna with my family This message is to report an annoyance that occurred in the restaurant 1500 Foodmakers a restaurant at 25hours Hotel Vienna I confess that it was not a hassle but a lack of education the degree of which I have never seen before in my life I have frequented restaurants worldwide but it was only in Vienna that I was so surprised something from another planet happened to me and my family I made a reservation in the hotel restaurant for a dinner with my family on February 18 2016 All was going well and the food was very good by the way Suddenly the head of the restaurant sat next to my son and quietly said that we should change tables We wondered why She said that there was a group that had made a reservation for that location and they had arrived 10 minutes before the booked time and for this reason we should leave the place But we had not yet finished the meal We told her that we would be finished the meal within 10 minutes but she said that would not be possible The feeling was one of humiliation and discrimination like she thought we were capable of a crime I confess that the city of Vienna is beautiful and the hotel is interesting but I would say that it lacks heart it s almost a home but not quite Rather it is a joke Let s spend a night together I tried to let it
