# The cross-product of each of the sections below will constitute the full test run.

# The test suite will only check that the appropriate python version is being used,
# it will not attempt to actually switch the python environment. In Github Actions,
# an external script will first resolve the python environment, install that version
# of python, and write the version number to `test_python_version.txt` file in this
# directory.
#
# The test suite will check the python version present at, in order of precedence,
# 1) the version in `test_python_version.txt` (for GH Actions runs) and 2) the version
# resolved directly from the options (for local runs).
